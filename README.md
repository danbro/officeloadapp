# Office load: A MATLAB application

Generate and analyze synthetic electricity load profiles of office buildings

This application generates synthetic electricity load profiles of office buildings using a consumer load model. The user can change select model parameter values and generate data for different time resolutions and periods. The application uses a consumer load model which was published in a scientific journal.
