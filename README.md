## A MATLAB application

Generate and display synthetic office electricity load profiles down to minute resolution

This application generates and displays synthetic office electricity load profiles for different time resolutions and periods using an underlying consumer load model published in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.10.141. Select model parameters as well as resolution, time period, and number of office buildings are configurable within the application.
